// Declaration of your component's version information
// Since foobar2000 v1.0 having at least one of these in your DLL is mandatory to let the troubleshooter tell different versions of your component apart.
// Note that it is possible to declare multiple components within one DLL, but it's strongly recommended to keep only one declaration per DLL.
// As for 1.1, the version numbers are used by the component update finder to find updates; for that to work, you must have ONLY ONE declaration per DLL. If there are multiple declarations, the component is assumed to be outdated and a version number of "0" is assumed, to overwrite the component with whatever is currently on the site assuming that it comes with proper version numbers.
